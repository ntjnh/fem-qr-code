## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Custom CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first

### What I learnt

Wouldn't say I learnt anything new but it was a really good way to practice the little bit of React that I've learnt so far.

### Continued development

I definitely want to keep doing more challenges with React and eventually be able to build more complex things with it to really solidify my knowledge and strengthen my new skill.
